## About Leah

I am an educator, ecologist and data scientist. I am passionate about democratizing
data science education through online learning. I started my career pursuing
Landscape Architecture but found myself drawn strongly to science. After spending
some time as an AmeriCorps volunteer, I found a job at Penn State working in the
Land Analysis Lab and among other things, teaching GIS. I decided to pursue a
Ph.D. in ecology with a focus on using LiDAR remote sensing data to understand
vegetation health and structure at a landscape level.

During my Ph.D. I learned to code - the hard way on my own. After that experience,
I was inspired to help others work with data to support their science. I moved
on to work at the National Ecological Observatory Network in Boulder, Colorado.
Here I build the NEON Data Skills program which was an online open education
portal that helped people use NEON and related types of data.

A few tidbits about me:

* I've never had any formal classes or training in GIS, remote sensing, data science or programming. But I love them all and love to learn and read even more.
* I'm inspired by doing things that have high, positive impact on others. This is why I love teaching.
* I find coding to be relaxing. It's kind of like working on a puzzle but more mentally engaging and infinitely rewarding.
* In my free time you can find me running long distances in the mountains.  

I'm currently the director of Earth Analytics Education at Earth Lab, University
of Colorado Boulder. Here I get to work with a pretty great team of educators, students,
scientists and data scientists.
