Open source refers to a (programming) tool or project where the (source) or
the code used to build the tool is available for anyone to see, use and
contribute to. If the tool is free, it will be referred to as FOSS or Free Open
Source Software. To make it easier to teach earth data science I help build
free open source software tools. Below are some of the free-to-use open source
projects that i'm currently leading.


## pyOpenSci

pyOpenSci is a community that promotes open science through supporting development
and peer review of scientific software written in the `Python` programming language.
pyOpenSci is modeled after rOpenSci.

I currently am organizing and leading the pyOpenSci effort with several colleagues.
We are now solidifying the peer review process and gathering community support.
Ultimately we'd like to see it grow as rOpenSci has and have
funded full time positions in addition to the wealth of community contributed
time.  

<!-- ** Might be cool to gather a list of collaborators here?? -->

## Open Source Software Tools That I Am Currently Working On

I am leading the development of several free open source software tools for
`Python`. These tools have been developed collaboratively with colleagues at
Earth Lab, undergraduate interns and graduate students. `EarthPy` is used
extensively as a part of the `earth-analytics-python` open education course.
`Matplotcheck` was designed to support unit testing of plots for autograding
student assignment. It also is useful for developing unit tests in
Python packages that have plots.
